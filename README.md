### Hi there 👋
My name is Barbara and I am a Front End Developer. 
Welcome to my profile :)

* 💁🏻‍♀️ About me: 
Before becoming a developer I was a ... lawyer (for almost 10 years!)
Passionate about science and technology, I approached the world of information technology during the years of the legal profession. Fascinated by the great potential of tech in the business world and its possible application developments, I decided to set aside the civil code and pursue my new passion... source code!
